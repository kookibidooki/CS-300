# CS-300

### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

This course had us, the students, explore and implement various data structures in order to not only see how they functioned, but also see when they were appropriate to use and the best choice for a project. The overall problem solved with the Project Two was to decide and implement a data structure would be best for a program that would read a file regarding college courses, store its course data, load the data into our chosen data structure, display the courses alphanumerically, search for a specific course, and display course information including prerequisites. The data structures we were to choose from was a vector, a hash table, or a binary search tree.

### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I was going to approach this project by implementing a hash table, but after further research and decision making, I actually ended up choosing a BST (binary search tree) as my data structure of choice. I liked how it was pre-sorted when the data was loaded, and didn't really require an extra step to do so like the other options. Data structures are important to understand as deciding what structure to implement for a program is incredibly important. Each structure has pros and cons, and will greatly change the performance and overall efficiency of a program. 

### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered?

Often when I feel stuck, I looked at my previous work to see how it was implemented then. For our final project, I was able to refer to a previous assignment where we completed code for a BST. Other than referring to textbook examples and basic BST implementation, I actually found myself stuck more on input validation rather than just the data structure itself. With that, I found my best bet was reaching out to a peer, as having a new pair of eyes on the project allows for them to approach it with an impartial perspective. 

### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This work has definitely reaffirmed one vital position when designing software and developing programs: never force yourself to do it alone! It is so much more work and way more exhausting to attempt an entire program or system, even if it is as "simple" as reading a file and displaying the data in a certain way. The CS community seems to do its best when working with others, allowing more perspectives and approaches to be considered during the process. Even as a solo dev, there should always be a place for you to reach out for assistance or different methods of implementation. 

### How has your work on this project evolved in the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

My work on this project really maintained the approach of staying organized and showing "why." Maintainable, readable, and adaptable code should always be able to show WHY something was implemented the way that it was. If that is by code notes, a design document, or otherwise, I just find this to be so so so important for a code to have longevity. Getting code with methods and functions that don't have a discernable reason for their implementation can be perplexing, and lead to lost time when just trying to figure out why it was included.
